# TripleA Maps Project

* Map Making: https://github.com/triplea-maps/Project/tree/master/MapMakingTools
* Admin Setup: https://github.com/triplea-maps/Project/tree/master/bin
* Game engine: http://github.com/triplea-game/triplea


## How to play a map pre-release
Three ways:
1. If the map is officially part of the maps project, then look for the releases section of the map, and then look for the zip file download link. Example:
* https://github.com/triplea-maps/world_war_ii_g40_balanced/
* https://github.com/triplea-maps/world_war_ii_g40_balanced/releases

2. You can also go to the main page of the map, and click "clone or download", and save the map repo as a zip. Then extract the contents of that zip into the triplea 'downloadedMaps' folder (you can set this path from within the game via the settings window)

3. You can do a 'git' clone of the map repo directly to 'downloadedMaps'


## How to Report a Problem with a Map
