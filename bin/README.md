## General Admin Documentation

To clone everything:
```
$ cd ~/work/maps  ## or wherever you wish to use as a working root folder
$ git clone git@github.com:triplea-maps/Project.git
$ ./Project/bin/clone_all.sh
```
Note, new map repos will take time to show up in the github CLI API, perhaps up to a day or more.

### Admin Map Uploads

#### Prep authentication files
- create a folder ~/.github
- create a file: ~/.github/bot_passsword, then type in the bot password as line 1
- create a file: ~/.github/token, in that file you'll add a personal access token from github:
  - head to: https://github.com/settings/profile > personal access tokens > generate new token
  - give the token a name, and the following access: ` public_repo, read:org, repo:status`
  - you'll be shown the token value, copy token value to the first line of the "token" file
- create a file ~/.github/bot_token, open a web browser in incognito/private mode, and repeat the steps above but log in as 'tripleabuilderbot', and give the token only `public_repo`


#### Stage the zip file
**Note**: Check that the zip file is zipped correclty. If a "map_name.zip" unzips to a "map_name" folder, then it was zipped 'wrong'. Unzip it, cd to the map_name folder, then rezip it with: `zip -r map_name.zip *`

I have a ~/work/maps folder where I stage/root everything. Move the map zip file in to that folder. Then you'll run `./Project/bin/createMapRepo.sh -m <map>`


Example:
```
cd ~/work/maps
mv ~/Downloads/mapZipFile.zip ./
./Project/bin/createMapRepo.sh -m mapZipFile.zip
```

Example2:

```
#TODO: document the formatting/structure of the zip file required, post those instructions to 'how to get your maps uploaded'

$ cd ~/work/maps
$ mv ~/Downloads/big_world_1939.zip ./
$ ./Project/bin/createMapRepo.sh

Usage: ./createMapRepo.sh -m <MAP>
  admin_token_file = file with one line, an an organization owner
  bot_token_file = personal access token of the github account
  bot_password_file =  file containing the password of the bot account
 -d = use defaults:
     -a ~/.github/token
     -b ~/.github/bot_token
     -p ~/.github/bot_password

$ ./Project/bin/createMapRepo.sh -m big_world_1939.zip 

```

### Admin Fix Travis - Regenerate Tokens
Each map needs two tokens on the builder bot account.
1. One that looks like this (hand created): automatic releases for triplea-maps/elemental_forces (tag pushes)
2. A second that looks like this (setup by travis ruby): automatic releases for triplea-maps/elemental_forces


To re-kick the travis token generation:
- locally find the .travis.yml file and delete everything in the 'deploy section'
- run: `travis setup releases`, use the tripleabuilderbot credentials
- Now fix up the .travis.yml file so the only thing that changes is the deploy key
- Push and verify the build works well
